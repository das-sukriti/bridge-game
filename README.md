# Bridge Game
The goal of this application is to produce a beautiful and functional web app that shuffles four hands and determines the number of points a hand is worth in bridge

To run the application, run the following:
1) npm run install
2) npm run start

(Press "a" to run all tests)

On the landing page, we will see for players at a table. Opposite players are marked with the same color to denote that they are playing together. In the center we will see a deck of cards placed.

On clicking the deck of cards, the cards get shuffled and distributed among the four playes, facing upside down. On clicking any one set of cards, the 13 cards will appear face up, along with a summary of the points accumulated in the hand. The point system are as follows:
An Ace is worth four points, a King is worth three points, a Queen is worth two, and a Jack is worth one.

On clicking on the different set of cards we can see the card points gathered by the players. To reshuffle, please reload and start again.
